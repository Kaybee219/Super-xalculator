# Super-Calculator
📌 Project: Freshman Calculator

This is a Python calculator I built during my freshman year at the University of Texas at Dallas. It was one of my earliest programming projects and a big step in learning how to combine logic, functions, and user interaction with a graphical interface.

🔢 Features

Perform basic arithmetic: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division

Trigonometric functions: sine, cosine, tangent

Advanced operations: factorial, square, square root, logarithms, exponents

Constants: π and e

Error handling (e.g., dividing by zero)

GUI built with Tkinter for an interactive experience

🛠️ Tech Stack

Language: Python

Library: Tkinter (GUI)

Environment: Desktop Application

🎯 Purpose

The goal of this project was to strengthen my programming foundations while exploring how to design an interactive app. It taught me how to connect logic to a user interface and sparked my interest in building practical tools. Though a beginner project, it represents an important milestone in my growth as a developer.
Environment: [e.g., CLI / Console Application]

🎯 Purpose

The goal of this project was to strengthen my foundational programming skills and apply problem-solving strategies in a practical way. While basic, it represents my early journey into computer science and serves as a milestone in my growth as a software engineer.
